# Phycis Engine analysis and implementation


- [ ] Vector Analysis incluing (create a vector, vector projection, vector
  transformation ..etc.)

- [ ] Linear Motion in 2-dimensions and how to use the vectors with them.
- [ ] Numerical analysis comparison among different ordinaray differential
  equations with first order and initial value problems.
- [ ] Linear motion integration types (Euler's, Runge-Kutta ..etc.)
- [ ] Linear motion in circiular motion, and introduction to the polar
  coordinates.
- [ ] Time-delta calculation and frame per second implementation.
- [ ] Camera movement in 2D planner, and their types.
- [ ] implementation for the nature of code in `pygame` using the code
  challenges such as:
    - Proof the `PI` and number of clicks of two solid objects.

- [ ] Working on numerical theortical programming with Rust and how to implment
  same in `Rust-2d engine`.
