# Physics Engine analysis and implementation

- [x] Vector Analysis including (create a vector, vector projection, vector
  transformation ..etc.)
- [x] Matrix and vector transportation visually.

- [x] Linear Motion in 2-dimensions and how to use the vectors with them.
- [x] Numerical analysis comparison among different ordinary differential
  equations with first order and initial value problems.
- [x] Linear motion integration types (Euler's, Runge-Kutta ..etc.)
- [x] Linear motion in circular motion, and introduction to the polar
  coordinates.
- [x] Time-delta calculation and frame per second implementation.
- [x] Camera movement in 2D planner, and their types.
- [x] implementation for the nature of code in `pygame` using the code
  challenges such as:
    - Proof the `PI` and number of clicks of two solid objects.

- [x] Working on numerical and theortical algorithms using advanced  programming with Rust and
  how to implementation same in `Rust-2d engine`, transfer the knowledge using the `bevy` game engine.


## Development and implementation

- [x] Pygame fundamentals including:
    - `rect` method for objects.
    - time-delta and calculation precise.
    - Camera placement and their types.
- [ ] Create canvas with features:
    - Centered with shifting the coordinates of a given
    - labeled for the coordinates spacing and jumping over grid lines.
    - proportional to the `HIGHT` and `WIDTH` of the canvas.
    - grid-lines refined as a mesh with coarse and fine grids proportional to canvas geometric characteristics.
